# Rabin-Karp-Algorithm
This program is written in C language and includes all the essential concepts of this programming language.
Rabin-karp algorithm is a string searching/matching algorithm that uses hashing to find patterns
in strings. Unlike other string matching algorithm, it does not travel through every character in
the initial phase rather it filters the characters that do not match and then performs the comparison.
String matching is a very important application of computer science. If youâ€™ve ever searched
through a document for a particular word, then you have benefitted from string-matching
technology.
Though this project looks simpler and with shorter length but the calculations of Rabin karp makes
it special and difficult to understand. Wherever there is a function of string matching, Rabin karp
algorithm is must in use.
